* var / let / const
var variables are scoped to the function, no the scope!

if(age>10)
{
	var aux = age * 10;
}

Aux is global! not scoped to {]} --> Use let to make it scoped only to block.
let will throw error if declared twice, which is not the case with var.
const are constants, cannot be updated, it will throw an error, but you can add properties!
	// Modifying const?
	const person = {
		name: 'Juan'
	}

	//This will throw an error
	person = {
		name: 'Pedro'
	}

	// No error here
	person.name = 'Pedro';
